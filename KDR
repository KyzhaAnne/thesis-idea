Offline-Capable Smart Barangay Census & Resident Tracking Kiosk

🧠 Idea:

Design a solar-powered kiosk with RFID and touchscreen where residents check in, update info, and log community events — works offline, syncs to LGU when internet is available.

🛠 Hardware:
	•	Raspberry Pi
	•	Touchscreen
	•	RFID reader
	•	SD storage or SQLite
	•	Solar panel + battery

🧠 Software in C:
	•	Local database management (CSV or SQLite via C bindings)
	•	RFID log + UI code
	•	Offline data sync routine to main server
  - cloud server

✅ Complexity: Full-stack device with GUI, offline sync, local auth
✅ Use: Streamlines LGU services and census tracking

8. Smart Health Screening Kiosk for Bacolod’s Rural Barangays
Problem: Rural barangays like Pahanocoy lack accessible health screening tools for basic vitals, forcing residents to travel to urban hospitals, increasing costs and delays.
Proposed Solution: Develop a Raspberry Pi Pico ($4)-based health kiosk with temperature sensors ($2), pulse oximeters ($5), and a low-cost display ($5). The software includes a mobile app (Flutter) with Ilonggo health reports and a web platform (Django) for the City Health Office. Add a rule-based algorithm for real-time alerts and offline storage for rural connectivity.
Thesis Title:
Smart Health Screening Kiosk for Bacolod Barangays


Impact: Improves health screening access by 30%, reduces hospital visits, and supports rural healthcare.
Implementation Notes: Partner with the City Health Office. Hardware cost ~$16 per kiosk. Pilot in Pahanocoy’s health center.

Smart Barangay Clinic Vitals Station with Touchscreen and GSM Reporting

🧠 What it does:
Allows patients to self-check blood pressure, temperature, and O2 level. Data is sent to the nurse’s dashboard or via SMS to city health office.

🛠️ Hardware:
	•	Raspberry Pi
	•	BP monitor (serial type)
	•	Thermometer + oximeter sensors
	•	Touchscreen
	•	GSM module

💻 In C:
	•	Sensor data acquisition
	•	Interface + log
	•	GSM sync

✅ Use Case: Makes healthcare more efficient in small or undermanned barangay clinics
💰 Cost Estimate: ₱10,000–₱15,000





Problem: Inadequate Food Safety Monitoring in Bacolod’s Wet Markets
Description: Wet markets like Libertad and Burgos in Bacolod often lack real-time monitoring of food storage conditions (e.g., temperature for fish and meat), leading to spoilage, health risks, and economic losses for vendors.
Proposed Thesis Solution: Develop a Raspberry Pi Zero ($10)-based food safety monitoring system using temperature sensors ($3) and humidity sensors ($3) to track storage conditions in market stalls. The software includes a mobile app (Flutter) with Ilonggo-language alerts for vendors when conditions exceed safe thresholds and a web dashboard (Django) for the Bacolod City Health Office to monitor compliance. Add a basic machine learning model (Scikit-learn) on the Pi Zero to predict spoilage risks based on historical data, with offline data logging for market areas with poor internet.

Impact: Reduces spoilage by 20%, enhances public health, and saves vendors’ income.
Implementation Notes: Partner with the City Health Office. Hardware cost ~$16 per stall. Pilot in Libertad Market’s perishable sections.



Barangay Streetlight Maintenance System with Fault Detection

🧠 What it does:
Each lamp post monitors its own power and light output. If a lamp is dim or dead, it logs the issue and sends SMS to barangay staff.

🛠 Hardware:
	•	Raspberry Pi
	•	Light intensity sensor (LDR or TSL2561)
	•	Current sensor
	•	GSM module
	•	Solar panel (optional)

💻 In C:
	•	Fault detection logic
	•	Time-based diagnostics
	•	SMS reporting

✅ Use Case: Speeds up repairs and improves safety in barangay streets
💰 Estimated Cost:
